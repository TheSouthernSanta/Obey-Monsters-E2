# Obey-Monsters-E2
this is the repo for a Wiremod Expression 2 chip of my creation under the name of 666santa called Obey Monsters.
To use this you will need Garry's Mod to run Wiremod and The E2, Wiremod(obviously), most importantly EXPRESSION2 in your tools list. and you will need the patcher e2 to bring all the parts together and stay up to date with incoming code.

# Errors about loading an include directive??
This means that a file is missing to be added to the E2 upon launch. This e2 hides away all the nasty spaghetti code somewhere else on your pc, the path for this folder is below.

By default if you have installed steam with the default settings you should be able to find your Garry's Mod ObeyMonsters files under this path

C:\Program Files\Steam\steamapps\common\GarrysMod\garrysmod\data\e2files\ObeyMonstersTSS
C:\Program Files(x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\GarrysMod\garrysmod\data\e2files\ObeyMonstersTSS

What you will need to do is go to the path and delete the version file. This will automatically say that you have no version of the e2 files installed and will redownload all the files again.

If this still does not work, feel free to email me about it on iskrewitup@gmail.com (don't laugh at my rediculous email) and pick a sandbox server with wiremod that I can join and help you with your launcher errors :)
